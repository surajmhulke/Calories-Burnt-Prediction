# calories-burned-prediction


With this you will be able to evaluate how many calories you would burn during a specific duration.This app takes some parameters such as your `age` , `gender` , `exercise duration` etc. and then this app evaluates the amount of calories you would burn.In addition, you will be able to observe similar results and general informations(according to the parameter values that you would enter into application).  


In this article, we will learn how to develop a machine learning model using Python which can predict the number of calories a person has burnt during a workout based on some biological measures.

Importing Libraries and Dataset
Python libraries make it easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib/Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.
Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries are having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.
